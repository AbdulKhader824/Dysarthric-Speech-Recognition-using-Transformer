       " 'LJ001-0059': 'the greater part of these Italian printers, it should be mentioned, were Germans or Frenchmen, working under the influence of Italian opinion and aims.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0060': 'It must be understood that through the whole of the fifteenth and the first quarter of the sixteenth centuries',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0061': 'the Roman letter was used side by side with the Gothic.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0062': 'Even in Italy most of the theological and law books were printed in Gothic letter,',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0063': 'which was generally more formally Gothic than the printing of the German workmen,',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0064': 'many of whose types, indeed, like that of the Subiaco works, are of a transitional character.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0065': 'This was notably the case with the early works printed at Ulm, and in a somewhat lesser degree at Augsburg.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0066': \"In fact Gunther Zeiner's first type (afterwards used by Schussler) is remarkably like the type of the before-mentioned Subiaco books.\",\n",
       " 'LJ001-0067': 'In the Low Countries and Cologne, which were very fertile of printed books, Gothic was the favorite.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0068': 'The characteristic Dutch type, as represented by the excellent printer Gerard Leew, is very pronounced and uncompromising Gothic.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0069': \"This type was introduced into England by Wynkyn de Worde, Caxton's successor,\",\n",
       " 'LJ001-0070': 'and was used there with very little variation all through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and indeed into the eighteenth.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0071': \"Most of Caxton's own types are of an earlier character, though they also much resemble Flemish or Cologne letter.\",\n",
       " 'LJ001-0072': 'After the end of the fifteenth century the degradation of printing, especially in Germany and Italy,',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0073': 'went on apace; and by the end of the sixteenth century there was no really beautiful printing done:',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0074': 'the best, mostly French or Low-Country, was neat and clear, but without any distinction;',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0075': 'the worst, which perhaps was the English, was a terrible falling-off from the work of the earlier presses;',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0076': 'and things got worse and worse through the whole of the seventeenth century, so that in the eighteenth printing was very miserably performed.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0077': 'In England about this time, an attempt was made (notably by Caslon, who started business in London as a type-founder in seventeen twenty)',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0078': 'to improve the letter in form.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0079': \"Caslon's type is clear and neat, and fairly well designed;\",\n",
       " 'LJ001-0080': 'he seems to have taken the letter of the Elzevirs of the seventeenth century for his model:',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0081': 'type cast from his matrices is still in everyday use.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0082': 'In spite, however, of his praiseworthy efforts, printing had still one last degradation to undergo.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0083': 'The seventeenth century founts were bad rather negatively than positively.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0084': 'But for the beauty of the earlier work they might have seemed tolerable.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0085': 'It was reserved for the founders of the later eighteenth century to produce letters which are positively ugly, and which, it may be added,',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0086': 'are dazzling and unpleasant to the eye owing to the clumsy thickening and vulgar thinning of the lines:',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0087': 'for the seventeenth-century letters are at least pure and simple in line. The Italian, Bodoni, and the Frenchman, Didot,',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0088': 'were the leaders in this luckless change, though our own Baskerville, who was at work some years before them, went much on the same lines;',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0089': 'but his letters, though uninteresting and poor, are not nearly so gross and vulgar as those of either the Italian or the Frenchman.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0090': 'With this change the art of printing touched bottom,',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0091': 'so far as fine printing is concerned, though paper did not get to its worst till about eighteen forty.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0092': \"The Chiswick press in eighteen forty-four revived Caslon's founts, printing for Messrs. Longman the Diary of Lady Willoughby.\",\n",
       " 'LJ001-0093': 'This experiment was so far successful that about eighteen fifty Messrs. Miller and Richard of Edinburgh',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0094': 'were induced to cut punches for a series of \"old style\" letters.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0095': 'These and similar founts, cast by the above firm and others,',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0096': 'have now come into general use and are obviously a great improvement on the ordinary \"modern style\" in use in England, which is in fact the Bodoni type',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0097': 'a little reduced in ugliness. The design of the letters of this modern \"old style\" leaves a good deal to be desired,',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0098': 'and the whole effect is a little too gray, owing to the thinness of the letters.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0099': 'It must be remembered, however, that most modern printing is done by machinery on soft paper, and not by the hand press,',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0100': 'and these somewhat wiry letters are suitable for the machine process, which would not do justice to letters of more generous design.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0101': 'It is discouraging to note that the improvement of the last fifty years is almost wholly confined to Great Britain.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0102': 'Here and there a book is printed in France or Germany with some pretension to good taste,',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0103': 'but the general revival of the old forms has made no way in those countries.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0104': 'Italy is contentedly stagnant.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0105': 'America has produced a good many showy books, the typography, paper, and illustrations of which are, however, all wrong,',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0106': 'oddity rather than rational beauty and meaning being apparently the thing sought for both in the letters and the illustrations.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0107': 'To say a few words on the principles of design in typography:',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0108': 'it is obvious that legibility is the first thing to be aimed at in the forms of the letters;',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0109': 'this is best furthered by the avoidance of irrational swellings and spiky projections, and by the using of careful purity of line.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0110': 'Even the Caslon type when enlarged shows great shortcomings in this respect:',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0111': 'the ends of many of the letters such as the t and e are hooked up in a vulgar and meaningless way,',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0112': \"instead of ending in the sharp and clear stroke of Jenson's letters;\",\n",
       " 'LJ001-0113': 'there is a grossness in the upper finishings of letters like the c, the a, and so on,',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0114': 'an ugly pear-shaped swelling defacing the form of the letter:',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0115': 'in short, it happens to this craft, as to others, that the utilitarian practice, though it professes to avoid ornament,',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0116': 'still clings to a foolish, because misunderstood conventionality, deduced from what was once ornament, and is by no means useful;',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0117': 'which title can only be claimed by artistic practice, whether the art in it be conscious or unconscious.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0118': 'In no characters is the contrast between the ugly and vulgar illegibility of the modern type',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0119': 'and the elegance and legibility of the ancient more striking than in the Arabic numerals.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0120': 'In the old print each figure has its definite individuality, and one cannot be mistaken for the other;',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0121': 'in reading the modern figures the eyes must be strained before the reader can have any reasonable assurance',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0122': 'that he has a five, an eight, or a three before him, unless the press work is of the best:',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0123': \"this is awkward if you have to read Bradshaw's Guide in a hurry.\",\n",
       " 'LJ001-0124': 'One of the differences between the fine type and the utilitarian must probably be put down to a misapprehension of a commercial necessity:',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0125': 'this is the narrowing of the modern letters.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0126': \"Most of Jenson's letters are designed within a square,\",\n",
       " 'LJ001-0127': 'the modern letters are narrowed by a third or thereabout; but while this gain of space very much hampers the possibility of beauty of design,',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0128': 'it is not a real gain, for the modern printer throws the gain away by putting inordinately wide spaces between his lines, which, probably,',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0129': 'the lateral compression of his letters renders necessary.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0130': 'Commercialism again compels the use of type too small in size to be comfortable reading:',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0131': 'the size known as \"Long primer\" ought to be the smallest size used in a book meant to be read.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0132': 'Here, again, if the practice of \"leading\" were retrenched larger type could be used without enhancing the price of a book.',\n",

       " 'LJ001-0134': 'In good printing the spaces between the words should be as near as possible equal',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0135': 'it is impossible that they should be quite equal except in lines of poetry',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0136': 'modern printers understand this, but it is only practiced in the very best establishments.',\n",
       " 'LJ001-0137': 'But another point which they should attend to they almost always disregard;',\n",

       " 'LJ001-0140': 'the desirable thing being \"the breaking of the line\" as in bonding masonry or brickwork',\n",

       " 'LJ004-0078': '\"The convicted delinquent has his rights,\" said Mr. Buxton authoritatively.',\n",

       " 'LJ004-0104': 'By the thirty-one George the third c. forty-six, s. five,',\n",
       " 'LJ004-0105': 'two or more justices were appointed visitors of prisons, and directed to visit and inspect three times every quarter.',\n",
